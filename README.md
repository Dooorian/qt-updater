qt-updater
==========

A Qt class to check, download and update an app.

It's a class created from simple parts assembled together to accomplish the hard work of updating an app.

It aims to make things easier for the user who just uses the app.

So, join me to improve this software.

# How to use #

```cpp
MyUpdateChecker *tUpdate = new MyUpdateChecker();
tUpdate->checkForUpdates();
```

**P.S.:** It has been tested only on Windows platforms!
